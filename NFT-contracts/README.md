ERC-721 Contracts

These contracts form a connected ecosystem for creating, minting, staking, and rewarding NFTs using an ERC20 token as a medium of exchange and reward. 
MyNFT is an ERC721 contract that allows users to mint unique NFTs with a specified tokenURI, giving each NFT metadata.
MyToken is an ERC20 contract that creates a fungible token used as a payment mechanism in the ecosystem.
The NFTMinter contract ties both by allowing users to mint NFTs by spending 10 ERC20 tokens, linking the NFT creation process with a token-based economy.
Lastly, the NFTStaker contract enables users to stake their NFTs, rewarding them with ERC20 tokens after a certain period of staking, further integrating the token and NFT functionalities.
Together, these contracts build a versatile dApp that blends fungible and non-fungible tokens, adding utility to both assets through staking, minting, and rewards.
