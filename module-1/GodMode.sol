PROMPT:
God mode on an ERC20 token allows a special address to steal other peopleâ€™s funds, create tokens, and destroy tokens.
Implement the following functions, they do what they sound like:

mintTokensToAddress(address recipient) mint function
changeBalanceAtAddress(address target) burn function
authoritativeTransferFrom(address from, address to) transfer function
